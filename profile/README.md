## Hi there 👋 Welcome to the PL/SQL Adventure!

### 🎉 **Project:** Dynamic Database Development with PL/SQL Magic!

Welcome to our capstone project repo! Here, we’re transforming raw data into meaningful insights, using **PL/SQL sorcery** and a touch of creativity. If you’re as excited about databases as we are, stick around! This is where theory meets practice, where code meets data, and where SQL spells turn into solutions. 🧙‍♂️💻

### 🏫 **What’s this all about?**
- **University:** Adventist University of Central Africa (AUCA)
- **Course:** Database Development with PL/SQL (INSY 8311)
- **Year:** 2024-2025
- **Lecturer:** Eric Maniraguha [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ericmaniraguha/)

We're a team of passionate learners diving into **real-world database design** and **PL/SQL programming** to tackle complex problems. Join us on this journey, where we’ll:
  - Define problems that only databases can solve (Phase 1: 🎯 Problem Statement).
  - Model business processes like pros (Phase 2: 🛠 Business Process Modeling).
  - Design robust data structures (Phase 3: 🗂 Logical Model Design).
  - Build actual PL/SQL Oracle databases (Phase 4: 💾 Database Creation).
  - Populate tables and manage data with finesse (Phase 5: 📊 Data Insertion).
  - Perform operations and keep data integrity in check (Phase 6: 🔄 Database Transactions).
